This project is an interactive website dedicated to exploring the universe. The idea was born from the desire to bring astronomy and space science closer to everyone, combining visual resources, real data, and interactive experiences.  

The site is not just a collection of information: it aims to **inspire curiosity** and show that space is a place for learning, imagination, and discovery.

## What We Have Built

- **Website design**: We created a modern and clear structure, with a homepage introducing the theme and sections dedicated to galaxies, planets, space missions, and fun facts.  
- **Educational content**: Articles and descriptions explain basic astronomy concepts in a simple way, so anyone can understand them.  
- **Interactive visualizations**: Using **Three.js**, we added 3D models and simulations that allow users to explore space dynamically.  
- **Real data integration**: We connected to **NASA’s Open APIs**, displaying authentic images and information from missions and astronomical observations.  
- **Attractive style**: With **TailwindCSS**, we designed a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly interface.  
- **Cloud deployment**: The project is configured to be easily deployed on platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**, making it accessible worldwide.
